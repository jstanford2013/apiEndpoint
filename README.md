# apiEndpoint
 
This is a super basic implementation of a flask API endpoint set up. 

I have added a get endpoint called "api-example" and this server will run on port 5002.

If you want to keep a history of your data, you could write to a sqlite db or something similar. If you just want just the latest value, you can just overwrite the json value at the top of the main component.
